If you have a love for technology and solving complex problems, cybersecurity and computer science offer exciting career opportunities. It’s not so much a matter of “cybersecurity vs. computer science,” but rather, which discipline speaks more to your personal career goals, strengths, and passions – as there is considerable overlap between these two areas. 

Both cybersecurity and computer science are growing fields that address the demand for qualified professionals to capably take on roles in these two arenas – especially as our world becomes increasingly more interconnected and dependent upon computer technology to power systems of information, commerce, and even energy. 

Computer science focuses on computational theory, which examines problem-solving through the lens of algorithms and computer networks. Cybersecurity also falls under the banner of computer science yet focuses more on protecting data, systems, and networks from various digital threats that could potentially compromise them.
