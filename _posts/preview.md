Typical Cybersecurity Courses
If you plan on studying cybersecurity, you can look forward to a course load emphasizing foundation technologies, such as networking, operating systems, and programming. 

Building on these fundamentals, individuals pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity delve deeper into more specialized courses, such as system security architecture principles as well as more specific system administration for operating systems such as Windows and Linux. Students will also build their knowledge of such subdisciplines as ethical hacking (also known as penetration testing), cyber threat intelligence, and policy development, including incident handling and response. 

Those pursuing a master’s degree in cybersecurity can advance their skillset via courses and hands-on projects in cybersecurity, as well as learn the finer points of threat modeling and more. In addition to more advanced fundamentals spanning various aspects of cybersecurity, those pursuing a master’s in this discipline can consider a specific area of focus to specialize in. For instance, some areas of specialization can include ethical hacking – poking at various systems and software to conduct a risk assessment, finding vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious (or unethical) hackers – or enterprise cybersecurity management.
