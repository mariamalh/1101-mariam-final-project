Typical Computer Science Courses
If you’re thinking about pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science, expect to dive into high-level math courses like algebra, trigonometry, and calculus, which are integral to understanding computational theory. Alongside these math-centric subjects, your curriculum will likely feature programming languages such as C++ and Java.

As you go further into your computer science studies, courses expand to include those related to studying algorithms, logic, problem-solving, and computer ethics, as well as programming languages. Your course load will combine practical applications (such as database design and computer architecture) and theoretical concepts. In addition, a computer science program encourages students to develop a concentration to help them carve out a career path. These competencies can range from software-focused (including engineering and testing) to application development, encompassing mobile apps, web applications, or even video games. 

A master’s in computer science takes you even deeper into programming and analysis of complex software systems, alongside weaving in elements of cybersecurity, threat identification, and response. Master’s programs typically include hands-on project-based learning, giving you opportunities to apply your skills.
